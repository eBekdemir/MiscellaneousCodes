# Solar System Simulation

### Description

This is a simple solar system simulation that visually represents the motion of planets around the Sun. The simulation uses basic physics and orbital mechanics to create a realistic movement of celestial bodies.

I've used pygame and numpy. Here are some features:

- Models the Sun and planets with approximate orbital paths

- Uses basic physics principles to simulate planetary motion

- Customizable parameters for scaling, speed, and planetary orbits
